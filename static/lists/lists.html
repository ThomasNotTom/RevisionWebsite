        A list is an example of an ADT. It is abstract as it has high levels of functionality and optimisation. However, this is hidden from the user.<br><br>

        A static size means the size will never change. If a lists size, or data, will never change then it should be an array. Most programming languages have functionality for both arrays and lists.<br><br>

        Examples of lists could include:


    <ul>
        <li>Students in a class</li>

        <li>Song lists</li>

        <li>Available products in a shop</li>
    </ul>
