        A scalar quantity has magnitude only.<br><br>

        A vector quantity has both magnitude and direction.<br><br>

        Vectors can be represented as a dictionary, 2D array or a series of values in a list.<br><br>

        Vectors can be used in graphics. For example, fonts are stored as a series of vectors. The computer can dynamically generate fonts based on an inputted size. This means that not every font size has to be stored, only a series of vectors.<br><br>

        2D vectors can be represented graphically with an arrow. Starting at the origin and pointing towards the x and y position of the vector.<br><br>

        Vectors can also be represented by the lowest domain that the vectors data will fall into. To the power of the size of the vector.<br><br>

        A map function can be used to convert data from one vector to another. Map will apply the function to each entry in the vector.<br><br>

        Vectors can be added. Let vector A be a 2D vector in the form (x1, y1), and let vector B be a 2D vector in the form (x2, y2). Then A + B = (x1 + x2, y1 + y2).<br><br>

        Vectors can be multiplied by a scalar (a non-vector number). Let vector A be a 2D vector in the form (x1, y1), and let B be a real number. Then A * B = (x1 * B, y1 * B).<br><br>

        Vectors can be multiplied by another vector of the same dimension. Let vector A be a 2D vector in the form (x1, y1), and let vector B be a 2D vector in the form (x2, y2). Then A dot B = (x1 * x2, y1 * y2).
