        What are data structures?<br><br>

        There are 3 different categories of data structure.<br>

    <ul>
        <li>Elementary (primitive) - Integer, Boolean, Char</li>

        <li>Composite - String, Array, List</li>

        <li>Abstract - List, Stack, Queue</li>
    </ul>
    The exact category each data type fits in, is language specific.<br><br>

    Composite data types are made from combining two or more elementary data types. For example in C/C++, a string can be defined as an array of pointers to constant characters. This would make it an elementary data type.<br><br>

    Abstract data types are made from combining two or more composite data types. For example a tree can be made from a series of nodes with any data type and a pointer to the next node.<br><br>

    Static data structures and data structures of a fixed size.  This means that they can never be made bigger or smaller. They usually take up a specific amount in memory and are, on average, faster.<br><br>
