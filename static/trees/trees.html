        A tree is an ADT with a root, branches and leaves. A tree is a connected, undirected graph with no cycles.<br><br>

        A binary tree is a tree were each node has at most two children. A common use case for a binary tree is for Huffman Encoding. Where each character is represented by a string of binary.<br><br>

        There are three main ways to traverse a binary tree. Pre-order, in-order and post-order.<br>
        <ul>
        <li>Pre-order begins at the root, then traverses the left sub-tree, then the right sub-tree.</li>

        <li>In-order begins at the left sub-tree, then the root, and then the right sub-tree.</li>

        <li>Post-order begins at the left sub-tree, then the right sub-tree and then the root.</li>
        </ul>

        A binary tree may be represented as an array of records. Each storing its own data, as well as the other nodes connected to it.
