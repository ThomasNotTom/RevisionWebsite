        Some searching methods include sequential and binary search. Each searching algorithm has different advantages and disadvantages. Sometimes a certain method works best with data between a certain length.<br><br>

        A hash table is an ADT, where data is organised based on a hashing function.<br><br>

        Collisions can occur when 2 different inputs into a hashing function, have the same output primary keys. Usually, collisions can be sorted by placing the data in the next available empty slot.<br><br>

        A dictionary is an ADT made of key, value pairs. Each pair has a key and a value. However, the value can be an ADT. So for example the value could be an array. The value in a dictionary is accessed using the key.<br><br>

        Examples of dictionaries include:

        <ul>
            <li>A phone book</li>

            <li>An actual dictionary</li>

            <li>An implementation of a tree or graph</li>
        </ul>

        Dictionaries are also used in JavaScript. Each JavaScript object is a dictionary. This format is known as the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON).
