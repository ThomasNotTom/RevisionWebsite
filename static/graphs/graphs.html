        A graph is an ADT used to represent complex relationships.<br><br>

        An undirected graph, has no direction and can be used to store scalar quantities. Such as distance between two towns. In this example, each town would be a node and the pathway between the two would be the edge. The distance is the edge’s weight.<br><br>

        A graph is defined as a set of nodes connected by arcs. Edges can be weighted, usually indicating a cost. In an undirected graph, all edges are bidirectional. In a directed graph, all edges are one-way.<br><br>

        Graphs can be drawn for a human. However, machines need the graph to be represented in a way they understand. This can be done in one of two ways, an adjacency matrix or adjacency list.<br><br>

        Graphs can be used to represent complex relationships. For example a social network. Where each user is a node, and the ‘closeness’ is defined by the edge’s weight.<br><br>
