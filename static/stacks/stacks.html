        Last in first out (LIFO) means that the last item that was put in, will be the first to come out. Like a stack of books. Only the top one can be removed.<br><br>

        Last in last out (LILO) means that the first item to be put in will be the last one out. Like a standard queue. First come, first served.<br><br>

        An overflow occurs when attempting to push onto a stack that is full.

        An underflow occurs when attempting to pop from a stack that is empty.

        The call stack is a system level data structure. It provides the tools for subroutines. In high level languages the call stack is hidden from the programmer.
