The 'main' HTML file can be found at 'static/home/home.html'. It can be opened by double clicking the file. THis should open the HTML file in the browser.

If this does not work, copy the full file path of the 'home.html' file. Make sure the file path ends with '/home.html' so the path points to the exact file. And manually paste this into the URL bar.

If you are having issues, make sure to extract the downloaded .zip file. Then open the HTML file.
